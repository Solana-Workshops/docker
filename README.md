# Workshop Dev Containers

## The Workshop Images

> If you're building any of these images on Mac or Windows (not WSL), you'll have to add `--platform linux/amd64` to your `docker build` command.

>  Building the Anchor image locally requires expanded RAM consumption in Docker. You can enable this in Docker settings.
